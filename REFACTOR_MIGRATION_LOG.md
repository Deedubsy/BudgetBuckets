## Performance Improvements
- ✅ Shared CSS files cached with 1-year max-age

## UI Enhancement Session - 2025-09-04

### Third-Party Tooltip Integration
- ✅ **Added Tippy.js + Popper.js**: Integrated professional tooltip library via CDN
- ✅ **Enhanced Budget Health Section**: Added informative tooltips for all health metrics
- ✅ **Fixed Duplicate Tooltips**: Resolved issue where both native and Tippy tooltips showed
- ✅ **Dynamic Tooltip Management**: Tooltips re-initialize when UI elements update
- ✅ **CSP Configuration**: Updated Content Security Policy to allow unpkg.com

### Budget Health Tooltip Content
- **Overall Status**: Explains budget health scoring system with expert recommendations
- **Budget Allocation**: Guidance on percentage of income allocated to buckets (80-95% optimal)
- **Over Budget Count**: Alerts about buckets that have exceeded planned spending
- **Savings Rate**: Financial expert recommendations (20%+ for excellent health)

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Tooltip initialization with professional configuration
tippy('[title]', {
    content: (reference) => {
        const title = reference.getAttribute('title');
        reference.removeAttribute('title'); // Prevent native tooltip
        return title;
    },
    placement: 'top',
    animation: 'fade',
    theme: 'dark',
    arrow: true,
    delay: [300, 0]
});
```

### Files Modified
- `app/app.js`: Added `initializeTooltips()` function and dynamic re-initialization
- `app/index.html`: Added Tippy.js and Popper.js CDN script tags
- `server.js`: Updated CSP scriptSrc to allow `https://unpkg.com`

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Professional dark-themed tooltips with smooth animations
- ✅ 300ms hover delay for better UX (prevents accidental tooltip triggers)
- ✅ Tooltips work correctly even when health metrics are dynamically updated
- ✅ Security-hardened (HTML content disabled in tooltips)

## Data Model Consolidation - 2025-09-04

### Problem Statement
The application had a complex subscription tracking system using multiple inconsistent fields:
- `subscriptionStatus: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'free'` 
- `planType: 'free' | 'plus' | 'free_pending'`

This led to data inconsistencies, complex validation logic, and user experience issues like:
- Plus users showing as "free_pending" 
- App redirecting paid users to plan selection
- Mismatched subscription status across different code paths

### Solution: Simplified Data Model
Consolidated to two clear fields:
- `plan: 'Free' | 'Plus'` - Single source of truth for plan type
- `planSelected: boolean` - Tracks if user completed plan selection flow

### Files Updated (13 total)

#### Core Application Files
- `app/app.js`: Updated user data loading and debug logging
- `app/app-init.js`: Simplified plan validation (only check `planSelected`)
- `app/account.js`: Updated user document display logic
- `app/lib/plan.js`: Simplified Firestore fallback plan detection
- `app/lib/bucket-store.js`: Updated user bootstrap to use new fields

#### Authentication & Plan Selection  
- `auth/firebase.js`: Updated `getCompleteUserData()` to return new fields
- `auth/js/auth.js`: Updated registration to set new fields
- `auth/js/choose-plan.js`: Updated plan selection logic and debug logging

#### Server-Side Integration
- `server.js`: Updated all webhook handlers and API endpoints:
  - Stripe subscription creation/update/deletion
  - Manual plan override endpoints
  - Webhook status mapping logic

#### Documentation & Tests
- `SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`: Updated expected user document structure
- `docs/auth-and-billing-flows.md`: Updated sequence diagrams and field references
- `docs/setup-stripe.md`: Updated webhook implementation examples
- `test-production-fixes.js`: Updated mock user bootstrap data

### Technical Benefits
- ✅ **Eliminated data inconsistencies** between subscription status and plan type
- ✅ **Simplified validation logic** across all authentication flows  
- ✅ **Reduced code complexity** - net removal of 25 lines of code
- ✅ **Improved debugging** with clearer field names and consolidated logging
- ✅ **Enhanced user experience** - no more incorrect plan detection/redirects

### Migration Strategy
- No data migration required - user confirmed clearing existing data
- All old field references removed from source code
- Only auto-generated coverage reports contain old field references (safe to ignore)

### Database Schema Changes
```javascript
// Before (complex, inconsistent)
{
  subscriptionStatus: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'free',
  planType: 'free' | 'plus' | 'free_pending'
}

// After (simple, consistent)  
{
  plan: 'Free' | 'Plus',
  planSelected: boolean
}
```
