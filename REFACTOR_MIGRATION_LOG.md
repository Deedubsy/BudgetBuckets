## Header Consistency

### Active States:
- Each page sets `active` parameter for nav highlighting
- CSS `.active` class applied to current page nav item

- Consistent mobile collapse on all pages
- Same breakpoints (1024px, 768px)  
- Unified hover and transition effects

## Validation

- ✅ All public routes render via EJS

### Automated Testing:

- ✅ Tests confirm responsive behavior

## Content Preservation
- ✅ All existing content/copy preserved exactly
- ✅ Structured data (JSON-LD) kept intact  
- ✅ Meta tags and SEO elements maintained
- ✅ JavaScript functionality preserved where applicable

## Performance Improvements
- ✅ Shared CSS files cached with 1-year max-age
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate CSS across pages (~373 total lines moved to shared files)
- ✅ Reduced HTML payload via template reuse
- ✅ Maintained gzip compression and security headers

## Security Notes
