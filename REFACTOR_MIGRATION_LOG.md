## UI Enhancement Session - 2025-09-04

### Third-Party Tooltip Integration
- ✅ **Added Tippy.js + Popper.js**: Integrated professional tooltip library via CDN
- ✅ **Enhanced Budget Health Section**: Added informative tooltips for all health metrics
- ✅ **Fixed Duplicate Tooltips**: Resolved issue where both native and Tippy tooltips showed
- ✅ **Dynamic Tooltip Management**: Tooltips re-initialize when UI elements update
- ✅ **CSP Configuration**: Updated Content Security Policy to allow unpkg.com

### Budget Health Tooltip Content
- **Overall Status**: Explains budget health scoring system with expert recommendations
- **Budget Allocation**: Guidance on percentage of income allocated to buckets (80-95% optimal)
- **Over Budget Count**: Alerts about buckets that have exceeded planned spending
- **Savings Rate**: Financial expert recommendations (20%+ for excellent health)

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Tooltip initialization with professional configuration
tippy('[title]', {
    content: (reference) => {
        const title = reference.getAttribute('title');
        reference.removeAttribute('title'); // Prevent native tooltip
        return title;
    },
    placement: 'top',
    animation: 'fade',
    theme: 'dark',
    arrow: true,
    delay: [300, 0]
});
```

### Files Modified
- `app/app.js`: Added `initializeTooltips()` function and dynamic re-initialization
- `app/index.html`: Added Tippy.js and Popper.js CDN script tags
- `server.js`: Updated CSP scriptSrc to allow `https://unpkg.com`

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Professional dark-themed tooltips with smooth animations
- ✅ 300ms hover delay for better UX (prevents accidental tooltip triggers)
- ✅ Tooltips work correctly even when health metrics are dynamically updated
- ✅ Security-hardened (HTML content disabled in tooltips)
