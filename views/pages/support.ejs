          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do I get started with Budget Buckets?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Start by setting your income amount and frequency in the "Income & Settings" section. Then create expense buckets for your regular spending categories (housing, transport, groceries, etc.) and add savings buckets for your financial goals. Add specific items to each bucket with their amounts.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Does Budget Buckets connect to my bank accounts?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              No, Budget Buckets is a manual budgeting tool. It doesn't connect to your bank accounts or automatically import transactions. You'll need to manually enter your spending and update your progress. This gives you full control over your data and privacy.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do savings goals work?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Savings buckets let you set a goal amount and target date. The app will calculate how much you need to save each period to reach your goal on time. You can also manually set your contribution amount and track your progress toward the goal.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I access my budget on multiple devices?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">

            <div class="faq-question">How do I backup my data?</div>

              Use the "Export" button in the app header to download a JSON file containing all your budget data. This serves as a backup that you can import later if needed. We recommend doing this regularly.
