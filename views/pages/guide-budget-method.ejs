          <h2>What Are Budget Buckets?</h2>
          <p>Budget buckets are simple containers for your money, organized by purpose rather than complex categories. Instead of tracking dozens of line items, you allocate money to a few meaningful buckets like "Housing & Utilities," "Food & Transport," and "Emergency Fund."</p>

          <h3>Why Buckets Beat Categories</h3>
          <p>Traditional budgeting fails because it's too granular. Buckets work because they:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce decision fatigue</strong> — 5-8 buckets vs 20+ categories</li>
            <li><strong>Match real spending</strong> — Money flows between related expenses naturally</li>
            <li><strong>Stay flexible</strong> — Overspend on groceries? It comes from your Food & Transport bucket</li>
            <li><strong>Work with any pay cycle</strong> — Weekly, fortnightly, monthly frequencies supported</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="viz">
            <div class="bucket">
              <h4>Housing & Utilities</h4>
              <div class="amt">$1,800/month</div>
            </div>
            <div class="bucket">
              <h4>Food & Transport</h4>
              <div class="amt">$800/month</div>
            </div>
            <div class="bucket">
              <h4>Emergency Fund</h4>
              <div class="amt">$500/month</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Setting Up Your Buckets</h2>
          <p>Follow this process to create buckets that actually work:</p>

          <h3>Step 1: Track Your Current Spending</h3>
          <p>Look at 2-3 months of bank statements and group expenses into natural clusters. Don't overthink it—if you regularly spend money on something, it needs a bucket.</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Choose Your Global Frequency</h3>
          <p>This is key: pick ONE frequency that matches your main income source. If you're paid fortnightly, think in fortnightly amounts for everything.</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr><th>Pay Cycle</th><th>Best For</th><th>Tips</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Weekly</td>
                <td>Hourly workers, freelancers</td>
                <td>Divide monthly bills by 4.33</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Fortnightly</td>
                <td>Most Australian employees</td>
                <td>Divide monthly bills by 2.17</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Monthly</td>
                <td>Salary workers, contractors</td>
                <td>Easiest for bill planning</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h3>Step 3: Create Your Buckets</h3>
          <p>Start with these essential buckets, then customize:</p>

          <h4>Essential Buckets</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Housing & Utilities</strong> — Rent/mortgage, electricity, gas, water, internet</li>
            <li><strong>Food & Transport</strong> — Groceries, fuel, public transport, car maintenance</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance & Bills</strong> — Health, car, contents insurance, phone bills</li>
            <li><strong>Personal & Entertainment</strong> — Dining out, streaming, hobbies, clothing</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Fund</strong> — Build to 3-6 months of expenses</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Optional Buckets (if they apply)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Debt Payments</strong> — Credit cards, personal loans (separate from mortgage)</li>
            <li><strong>Savings Goals</strong> — Holiday, car deposit, home deposit</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Expenses</strong> — Rego, insurance premiums, subscriptions paid yearly</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="tip">
            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Start with 5-6 buckets maximum. You can always add more later, but it's harder to simplify once you've complicated things.</p>

          <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
          
          <h3>1. Too Many Buckets</h3>
          <p>If you have more than 8-10 buckets, you're probably overcomplicating things. Combine similar expenses into broader buckets.</p>

          <h3>2. Mixing Frequencies</h3>
          <p>Don't think "rent is monthly but groceries are weekly." Pick one frequency and convert everything to match.</p>

          <h3>3. Perfect Allocation Paralysis</h3>
          <p>Your first budget won't be perfect. Start with rough estimates and adjust after a month or two of real data.</p>

          <h3>4. Ignoring Irregular Expenses</h3>
          <p>Car registration, annual insurance, holiday spending—these will break your budget if you don't plan for them.</p>

          <h2>Making It Work</h2>

          <h3>Review Monthly</h3>
          <p>Check if your bucket allocations match reality. Consistently overspending in one bucket? Either increase its allocation or examine your spending habits.</p>

          <h3>Use the 50/30/20 Rule as a Guide</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>50% Needs</strong> — Housing, utilities, groceries, transport, minimum debt payments</li>
            <li><strong>30% Wants</strong> — Entertainment, dining out, hobbies, non-essential shopping</li>
            <li><strong>20% Savings & Debt</strong> — Emergency fund, retirement, extra debt payments</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Start Conservative</h3>
          <p>It's easier to increase a bucket than to deal with constant overspending. Start with conservative estimates and adjust upward if needed.</p>

          <div class="tip">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The best budget is the one you'll actually use. Simple buckets that match your real spending patterns will always beat a complex system you abandon after two weeks.</p>
