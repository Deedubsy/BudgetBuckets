## Incident Detection

### Automated Monitoring

```javascript
// Client-side error detection
window.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
  const severity = classifyError(event.error);
  if (severity >= 'S3') {
    alertIncidentTeam(event.error);
  }
});

function classifyError(error) {
  // Firebase initialization failure = S2
  if (error.message.includes('Firebase: No Firebase App')) {
    return 'S2';
  }
  
  // Authentication failures = S2  
  if (error.message.includes('auth/')) {
    return 'S2';
  }
  
  // Database errors = S3
  if (error.message.includes('firestore/')) {
    return 'S3';
  }
  
  return 'S4';
}
```

### Manual Detection Sources

1. **User Reports**
   - Direct user feedback
   - Social media mentions
   - Support requests

2. **System Monitoring**
   - Health check failures
   - Performance degradation
   - Error rate increases

3. **External Services**
   - Firebase status page changes
   - Third-party service outages

## Response Procedures

### Immediate Response (0-5 minutes)

#### 1. Acknowledge Incident
```bash
# Create incident record
INCIDENT_ID="INC-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
echo "Incident ${INCIDENT_ID} - $(date)" > incidents/${INCIDENT_ID}.md

# Alert team
# Slack: @channel INCIDENT ${INCIDENT_ID} - [Brief description]
# Email: incident-team@company.com
```

#### 2. Initial Assessment
```bash
# Quick health checks
curl -I https://budgetbucket.app/  # Homepage
curl -I https://budgetbucket.app/auth/login.html  # Auth page
curl -I https://firebase.googleapis.com/  # Firebase API

# Check Firebase status
curl -s https://status.firebase.google.com/incidents.json | jq '.incidents[0]'

# Test core functionality
# Visit: https://budgetbucket.app/test/smoke-test.html?autorun=true
```

#### 3. Classify and Escalate
```markdown
**Incident Classification Checklist:**
- [ ] Can users access homepage?
- [ ] Can users sign in?  
- [ ] Can users load budget data?
- [ ] Can users save changes?
- [ ] Are there security concerns?

**Impact Assessment:**
- Affected users: [All/Some/Specific features]
- Duration: [Time since first report]
- User-facing impact: [Description]
```

### Investigation Phase (5-30 minutes)

#### 1. Gather Evidence

**System Logs**
```bash
# Firebase Console logs
# Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/budget-buckets-prod/overview

# Browser console errors (from user reports)
# Collect:
# - Error messages
# - Stack traces
# - Browser/OS information
# - Steps to reproduce
```

**Recent Changes**
```bash
# Check recent deployments
firebase hosting:releases:list --limit 5

# Review recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Check Firebase configuration changes
firebase firestore:rules:get > current-rules.txt
diff current-rules.txt previous-rules.txt
```

#### 2. Root Cause Analysis

**Common Failure Modes:**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Investigation Steps |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 5xx errors on homepage | Firebase Hosting issue | Check Firebase status, try redeploy |
| Authentication failures | Auth configuration issue | Check authorized domains, OAuth setup |
| Database errors | Firestore rules or connectivity | Test rules, check quotas |
| Slow performance | Network or query issues | Check CDN, review slow queries |
| JavaScript errors | Code deployment issue | Check console, compare with previous version |

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Test specific components
# Authentication:
firebase auth:export test-users.json --project budget-buckets-prod

# Database connectivity:
firebase firestore:indexes:list --project budget-buckets-prod

# Hosting status:
firebase hosting:channel:list --project budget-buckets-prod
```

### Resolution Phase (30+ minutes)

#### 1. Implement Fix

**Quick Fixes (S1/S2 incidents)**
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
PREVIOUS_RELEASE=$(firebase hosting:releases:list --limit 2 | tail -1)
firebase hosting:clone ${PREVIOUS_RELEASE} current

# Emergency maintenance page
echo "<h1>Budget Buckets is temporarily unavailable. We're working to restore service.</h1>" > maintenance.html
firebase deploy --only hosting:maintenance

# Clear CDN cache (if applicable)
# Firebase Hosting: No manual cache clear, redeploy instead
```

**Configuration Fixes**
```bash
# Fix Firestore rules
firebase firestore:rules:release backup-rules.txt

# Update authentication settings
# Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Settings
# Verify authorized domains, OAuth configuration

# Environment configuration
# Check auth/firebase-config.js for production values
```

#### 2. Verify Resolution

**Automated Verification**
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
curl "https://budgetbucket.app/test/smoke-test.html?autorun=true"

# Check key user flows
for endpoint in "/" "/auth/login.html" "/app/index.html"; do
  echo "Testing ${endpoint}:"
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} - %{time_total}s\n" "https://budgetbucket.app${endpoint}"
done
```

**Manual Verification**
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Login/signup flows work
- [ ] Existing users can access their data
- [ ] New users can create budgets
- [ ] Data saves and loads properly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (< 3s page load)

## Incident Prevention

### Proactive Monitoring

```javascript
// Enhanced error tracking
class IncidentDetector {
  constructor() {
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
    this.performanceMetrics = [];
  }
  
  trackError(error) {
    const errorKey = error.message.substring(0, 50);
    this.errorCounts.set(errorKey, (this.errorCounts.get(errorKey) || 0) + 1);
    
    // Alert if error rate exceeds threshold
    if (this.errorCounts.get(errorKey) > 10) {
      this.alertIncidentTeam('High error rate detected', error);
    }
  }
  
  trackPerformance() {
    const metrics = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
    this.performanceMetrics.push(metrics.loadEventEnd);
    
    // Alert if consistent slow performance
    const recent = this.performanceMetrics.slice(-5);
    if (recent.every(time => time > 5000)) {
      this.alertIncidentTeam('Consistent slow performance detected');
    }
  }
}
```

### Regular Health Checks

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# health-check.sh - Run every 5 minutes via cron

# Test key endpoints
endpoints=("/" "/auth/login.html" "/app/index.html")
failed=0

for endpoint in "${endpoints[@]}"; do
  response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://budgetbucket.app${endpoint}")
  if [[ $response -ne 200 ]]; then
    echo "ALERT: ${endpoint} returned ${response}"
    failed=1
  fi
done

# Test smoke test
smoke_result=$(curl -s "https://budgetbucket.app/test/smoke-test.html?autorun=true")
if [[ $smoke_result == *"FAILED"* ]]; then
  echo "ALERT: Smoke test failed"
  failed=1
fi

# Alert if any checks failed
if [[ $failed -eq 1 ]]; then
  # Send alert to monitoring system
  echo "Health check failure at $(date)" | mail -s "Budget Buckets Health Check Failed" incidents@company.com
fi
```
